During my years on PET I've participated in the development of many Courses and Lectures. Some of them are: <i>LaTeX, Advanced C, C++, Workshop of Robotics, and C for Engineers</i>.
For materials of these and other courses created and promoted by PET Computação, please head to <a href="http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/pet/index.php?option=com_docman&Itemid=17" class="urlextern" rel="nofollow">PET Computação Downloads Page</a>.
